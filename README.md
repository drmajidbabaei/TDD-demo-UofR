# TDD-demo-UofR

## Project Overview

This project implements Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles in Java to demonstrate how to write unit tests for core functionalities. The project focuses on two main classes:
1. `Certificate.java`
2. `OCSPResponder.java`
3. `Main.java`

By following TDD principles, you'll write unit tests for these classes before implementing the actual functionality. This ensures the code is designed with testability in mind and functions as expected.
